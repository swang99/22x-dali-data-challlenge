# DALI Data Challenge 22S

## Part 1 
Describe the dataset given with three or more data visualizations. These can be maps, histograms, line graphs, 
combinations of those, or anything else. It can be a time-series, or an interactive plot.

Think, if you could only show someone these graphs to describe most of the data, what graphs would you choose.

Design matters, making this beautiful matters.

The sky is the limit!



## Part 2
Part 2 is more free-form, and allows you to showcase YOUR specific skillset.

Here's a chance to showcase your data science skills!

Model this data! Predict some outcome, make some claims, show your work, analyse it statistically, and tell us your thinking all the way through. You can do machine learning, or deep learning or statistical analysis. Whatever interests you, go for it!

Be creative, think big, and report your findings in a clean, clear way!

* Count encoding limitation for product ID: When two products appear the same number of times, they become the same category, so the information distinguishing them is lost. 

* Initial Goal: Predict the product that the customer is most likely to buy given the state and category of the purchase
